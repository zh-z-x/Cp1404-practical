# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate accuracy was not very precise at first. I often underestimated how long tasks would take.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Over time, I became more realistic and better at predicting how much effort each task would require.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned to break tasks into smaller parts and to allow extra time for testing and debugging.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learned to write cleaner and more consistent code, and to follow style guidelines more carefully.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I improved my attention to detail and learned how different people solve the same problem in creative ways.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[https://github.com/ZawLattNaung/cp1404practicals/pull/2]()

### Explanation

I pointed out the areas in the code that could be improved and discovered a logical issue in a loop.


## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would add a bit more explanation before each task to help students understand the goal more clearly.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I completed all tasks on time and kept improving my code quality each week.
