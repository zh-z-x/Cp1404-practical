## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have started planning my code more before jumping into writing it, which has helped reduce bugs and made my work easier to test and read.

I need to be more consistent with time management and avoid leaving practicals to the last minute.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Iâ€™m actively reading instructions carefully and using version control for my code, which helps me track progress and revert changes when needed.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop rushing through tasks just to get them done. Instead, I should focus more on understanding and applying the core concepts thoroughly.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I hope to include more programming examples related to daily life, connecting the weekly themes with practical applications.
