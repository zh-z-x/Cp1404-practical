# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

About 60%.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I usually watch the lecture videos at home in the evening before the next class. I try to spend around 1 to 1.5 hours each time, depending on the topic.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I have been keeping up with the practical work each week and submitting on time. I also review the sample code after class to understand the concepts better.


## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop postponing the lecture videos until the last minute. Watching them earlier will help me understand the practicals better.


## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

Sometimes I follow the instructions without fully understanding the code. I will start adding more comments and testing the code more thoroughly to improve my understanding.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I am good at using functions and applying feedback from previous tasks. I also try to keep my code clean and well-structured.
