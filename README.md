## Key Lessons Learned about Clean Code

- **Meaningful variable and function names**: Clear and descriptive names make code easier to understand and maintain.
- **Consistent formatting**: Proper indentation, spacing, and alignment improve readability and reduce errors.
- **Small, reusable functions**: Breaking code into small functions with single responsibilities promotes modularity and reduces duplication.
